$ meteor npm install --save @popperjs/core
$ meteor npm install --save bootstrap@next

imported into main.js

import 'bootstrap';
import 'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.css';

Mongo collection defined as global in shared lib folder collections .js
moved template to separate file import in main.js

added simple schema via npm, collection2 via meteor for data validation
opted to fo form manually although autoform was tempting

installed fullCalendar eventually... meteor package didn't work
installed bootsrap version which required fontawesome (which required tweeking to work with meteor) but appears buggy...
using standard view for now

npm install --save @fullcalendar/core @fullcalendar/bootstrap
npm install --save bootstrap @fortawesome/fontawesome-free
